                <p>Christmas Day (December 25) is celebrated differently in Iraq than in the west, observed by the few remaining Christians in the country.

During the reading, family members hold lighted candles as they listen, and once the story is finished, a bonfire is lighted using the candles and a pile of dried thorns in the courtyard, symbolic of the future of the household in the coming year. Once the thorns have completely turned to ashes, family members jump over the remnants and make a wish. Religious services are also held in local churches, followed by processionals.</p><br>
